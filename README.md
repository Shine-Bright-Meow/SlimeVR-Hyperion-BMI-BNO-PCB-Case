| Rosin Flux | Liquid or Gel Type | N/A |

> [!NOTE]
> You will have a much better soldering experience with better tools. These are my recommended (but still on a budget) Soldering Iron and Solder Sucker if you don't have these tools or better already. They will work much better than those Amazon $10-20 soldering kits/iron.

> [!NOTE]
> The Soldering Iron listed requires an USB Type-C Power Delivery charging block of 60W or higher.

### Recommended Components (Case)
| Component | Variant | Link |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trilancer Elastic Cinch Straps | See note below | <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099RNRT7Z> |
| GoPro Chest Mount Harness | See note below | <https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805774922789.html> |

> [!NOTE]
> 12in works for ankles. 18in for thinner thighs and 24in for thicker thighs. Chest (if not using GoPro Chest Harness) and Hips can be done by doubling up on 18in/24in straps. Choose what you need for your body and how many trackers you are planning to make. 3 Size Combo and either 18in/24in package would be a start.

> [!NOTE]
> There are 2 types of GoPro Chest Mount Harness. One that clips in and the other one fasten by a bolt. Be sure to purchase one one for the case you are 3D Printing.

## Soldering/Assembly Guide

### Written Guide

> [!WARNING]
> Please work at a well ventilated area. It is recommended to use a fume extractor if working indoors. If you do not have one, use a fan to blow fumes/smoke away from your face.

> [!WARNING]
> It is recommended to use eye production. Especially when splitting header pins apart with a cutter and when trimming down header pins and ends of resistors/diodes.

> [!WARNING]
> If working with leaded solder, be sure to wash your hands when you are done including under your fingernails. Wipe down and vacuum the floors and surfaces of your workspace and anything you may have cross-contaminated.

> [!TIP]
> Using external flux (preferably Rosin) will allow solder to flow to automatically flow into the correct area.

> [!TIP]
> A wooden clothespin can be used to hold the boards together while soldering.

> [!NOTE]
> Resistor and Diodes

#### Battery Connector
##### With JST PH 2.0mm 2P Connector
<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Battery1.png">

1. Place connector as positioned on the photo. The opening should be facing teh cutout and the smooth side should be on top and the slotted side should e against the PCB.
2. Solder the 2 pins in the back.
3. Trim excess length of pins using a flush cutter. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter and cut as close the the PCB as you can.

> [!NOTE]
> If you got straight pin connectors, you can bend them 90 degrees, so they will work. There will be a little less pin length sticking out from the back to solder and there is a chance of you snapping them. You should have plenty of connectors incase the pin snaps.

##### Without JST Connector
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step should be done last after the entire board is assembled and after you verified that the solder joints all look fine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not solder the battery leads to the holes of the PCB. The angle will put stress on the wire and solder joint and will eventually break off.

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Battery2.png">

1. Strip the battery leads they are not exposed already.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not let the exposed battery leads make contact with each other.

2. Place your soldering iron on the BAT+ pad and melt the solder.
3. Place the **RED** battery lead in the molten solder pad and let it cool off.
4. Repeat the process for the BAT- pad and the **BLACK** battery lead.

##### Diodes
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the diode is facing the correct direction and has the correct values. It will not be easy to access the diode once you solder the IMU above it.

1. Verify that the diodes are 1N5817. You can find the text on the body.

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Diode1.png">

2. Place the diode's striped (grey/silver) on the narrow stripe indicated on the silkscreen.

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Diode2.png">

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Diode3.png">

3. Bend the ends in 90 degrees, so it is shaped like a staple and place into the through-hole.
4. Pull the excess on the back until diode is flush with the PCB.
5. Solder ends from the back.
6. Repeat for other diode.
7. Trim excess length of pins using a flush cutter. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter and cut as close the the PCB as you can.

##### Resistor
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the resistor is the correct value. It will not be easy to access the resistor once you solder the IMU above it.

1. Verify the resistor is 180K. The first 4 colors should go in this order:
- Brown
- Grey
- Black
- Orange

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Resistor.png">

2. Bend the ends in 90 degrees, so it is shaped like a staple and place into the through-hole. Resistors are not polarized, so the direction does not matter.
3. Pull the excess on the back until resistor is flush with the PCB.
4. Trim excess length of pins using a flush cutter. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter and cut as close the the PCB as you can.

#### Switch

##### DPDT 2P2T/SS22F32

##### SS12D00G3

#### Charging Board (TP4056)

#### IMU (BMI160 or BNO085)

#### MCU (WeMos D1 Mini)

## Troubleshooting

Join [SlimeVR Discord](https://discord.gg/SlimeVR) and ask in either the #technical-support or #DIY channels. It would be helpful for you to provide a description of your issue, photos of your soldering (front & back), and a log output from Settings > Serial Console with your tracker plugged into your computer via data USB cable into your WeMos D1 Port (non-charging). You will need to press the **Reboot** button to get the complete log.

### Using a Multimeter

1. Go to the drawing located [here](https://oshwlab.com/Newbie2620/slimevr-multi-imu-bmi-bno).
2. Scroll down to the PCB section and click the Open in Editor button.

<img src="Resources/Images/Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot1.png">

3. Mouseover each pad and see which pads they are also connected to.

<img src="Resources/Images/Troubleshooting/Troubleshoot2.png">

4. Set your multimeter to continuity mode.

<img src="Resources/Images/Troubleshooting/Multimeter.png">

5. Test for continuity between the pad you have highlighted with your mouse and every pad that is connected to it. Do this for every trace.

> [!NOTE]
> Also, test the switch for continuity in the on position.
